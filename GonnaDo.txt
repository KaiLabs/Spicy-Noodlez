      # rails generate scaffold add_FIELD_to_TABLE FIELD:FIELDTYPE
      # remove fields in db with 
      # rails generate scaffold remove_FIELD_from_TABLE FIELD:FIELDTYPE



Done:

2. Validators to make sure input fields are filled in COMPLETE
# https://github.com/adzap/validates_timeliness/
3. make sure posts/new and all these other paths redirects you to posts#index COMPLETE
7. Search bar for your active path : all or current path button
	7a. Search bar for your current path only... !! COMPLETE

3. Validate that events start in the future and end after that point COMPLETE
4. Validate that rides start in the future and end after that COMPLETE
5. Validate that found happened in the past COMPLETE
6. SSL
7. Error Handling
8. User Password Handling --> Gravatar
9. Users have usernmame/password/avatar/
		has_many posts, events, rides, ...
		but posts/events/rides/bla only has_one user.
10. log_in + Authenticated User
11. If authenticated then you can post/edit/delete otherwise just show.
	You can only post if youre logged in
	You can only edit/delete if youre the owner of the post
	You can show regardless of being logged in. 
12. When Search returns with 0 results. redirect to somewhere and flash[:danger] = "No results" 
	maybe --> have a before_action if there is a search and there are no results, then just print "nothing here" only: [:index]
9. Static Routes...help, about, contact
9. Email Account Confirmation
	https://coderwall.com/p/u56rra/ruby-on-rails-user-signup-email-confirmation-tutorial
4. Catching urls like localhost:3000/signout shouldn't sign you out unless you click the actual button!
1. Can Users delete themselves/ wipe everything? THat would be a User Destroy?
12. Rides: How many Seats available? Allow owner to update this information.
12. Get User Email from oauth so that we can send emails to users
6. When do certain items get deleted from the db?
	6a. Events: 5 days after they finish?
	6b. Rides: 6 hours after they start?
	6c. LostAndFound: After it has been claimed AND confirmed?
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22046616/rails-delete-object-10minutes-later-after-created
9. Contact Driver/Finder via email
	EMAILS SENDING AS OF NOW
	NEED TO HAVE the post as a param --> so that it can send msgs and whatever.

	PUT THAT IN THE VIEW for NEW and it shows up in CREATE
	DO THIS FOR ALL!!!!!!
	<%= hidden_field_tag 'owner', params[:owner] %>

	IN THE SHOW OR INDEX
	<%= link_to "Contact", new_email_path(owner: @ride.user_id) %>
	maybe also throw in a ride.id

	!!!!!!!
	instead of doing this in the create action
	just do it upon submitting?
	maybe create email_helper that sends emails???
	never create a db for it?
	only:  [:new]		but no edit, show, index
	!!!!!!!!!
12. Add Pictures --- see that gem that Tim posted
	GEM paperclip!
	DO THIS FOR ALL EVENTS, RIDES, LOST, SALE
Upvote/Downvote isn't really working?
You can't favorite an event that happened already?

1. Make sure that the has_and_belongs_to_many relationship ends when user is destroyed
2. Make sure that favorites are destroyed as well

1111. Admin!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?
		Admin model that allows priveleges
2. Filtering add by_date for all types of posts.

MAJOR ISSUE: GETTING EMAIL FROM THE OAUTH FAILS IN PRODUCTION?
1. BUG FOR auth.user.email

	THIS WAS JUST A DEVELOPMENT vs. PRODUCTION ISSUE
	I THINK!?

3. Nested Filtering?


5. Need a way for an admin to add other admins!!!
	Search through all users? to find one that you want to adminify

	Add Admin
	if current_user.admin ->
		User.find_by(email: "AOlafsson@wesleyan.edu").update_attribute :admin, true
	Delete Admin
	if current_user.admin -> 
		User.find_by(email: "AOlafsson@wesleyan.edu").update_attribute :admin, false
	Make sure there is always at least one ADMIN!
	Only Admin can add or delete --> before_action
	Show all admins --> Link to delete them next to it.



4. Create good seeds
10. Lost and Found --> tags: jewelry, clothing and then filter by those tags 
11. Calendar clicking for creating posts instead of dropdown



============================================
3. Two Views being rendered
11. Error Handling
11. https://github.com/reddit/reddit/tree/master/r2/r2/templates



1. Should ALL posts expire? Which ones should be pinnned



2. FrontEnd
